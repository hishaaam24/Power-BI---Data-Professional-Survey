The data was transformed using Power Query, and the dashboard highlights key insights and trends in geographical distribution, programming language preferences, work-life balance, salary satisfaction, and gender representation.

Key Insights:
1. Majority of data professionals surveyed are from the US (261 members).
2.Significant global representation, excluding US, UK, India, and Canada (224 members).
3. Python is the preferred programming language (414 members), with SQL also popular.
4. Marginal satisfaction with work-life balance and dissatisfaction with current salaries.
5. Data Scientists earn approximately $28,000 more on average than other job roles.
6. Men comprise 75% of survey takers, but women's average salary is 51% higher than men's.
